            <p class="main-para">Every great website is built on two strong foundations — one that shapes what users
                see and another that powers how it works behind the scenes.Together, they create seamless,
                interactive,
                and powerful digital experiences.</p>

                    Frontend Development is the part of web development that focuses on everything the user sees and
                    interacts with directly. It's about designing and building the visual layout, colors,
                    typography,
                    navigation menus, and interactive elements of a website or web app. Technologies like HTML, CSS,
                    and
                    JavaScript form the foundation, while frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular help developers
                    create dynamic and responsive interfaces. A good frontend ensures that a site is not only
                    beautiful
                    but also user-friendly, fast, and accessible across devices. In short, the frontend is where
                    creativity meets functionality to deliver an engaging user experience.

                    <h2 class="pillar-heading">Backend</h2>
                    Backend Development is the part of web development that works behind the scenes, making sure
                    everything on a website functions smoothly. It handles data storage, user authentication,
                    payments,
                    server logic, and communication between the website and the database. Backend developers work
                    with
                    programming languages like Node.js, Python, Java, or PHP, along with databases such as MySQL,
                    MongoDB, or PostgreSQL. While users never directly see the backend, it powers every interaction,
                    ensuring that the right data is delivered at the right time. In short, the backend is the brain
                    of a
                    website — silently running everything while the frontend takes the spotlight.
