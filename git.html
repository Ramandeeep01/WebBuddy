        <h1 class="hh">Git and GitHub – Version Control and Collaborative Development</h1>

        <p class="pp">Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in files, most commonly
            source code. It allows developers to maintain a complete history of their work, revert to earlier versions
            if needed, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other’s changes. Unlike older centralized
            systems, Git gives every developer a full local copy of the repository, meaning they can work offline,
            branch freely, and merge changes efficiently.
            <br><br>
            The core purpose of Git is change management. Developers create “commits” to record specific changes along
            with messages describing why those changes were made. Branches allow new features, bug fixes, or experiments
            to develop in isolation from the main codebase, minimizing disruption to stable versions. Git’s merging and
            conflict resolution tools ensure that contributions from multiple people can be combined systematically.
            <br><br>
            While Git is purely a tool that runs locally or on servers, it does not require the internet or a central
            service to function. However, to collaborate with others in a connected environment, teams often host
            repositories on a shared platform — and this is where GitHub comes in.
            <br><br>
            GitHub is a cloud-based platform built around Git, offering hosting for repositories along with tools for
            collaboration, communication, and project management. While Git handles the version history and branching
            logic, GitHub provides the interface, infrastructure, and social features that make large-scale teamwork
            easier. Developers can push their local Git commits to GitHub, where others can review, comment, and
            contribute through pull requests.
            <br><br>
            GitHub’s features extend far beyond simply storing code. It offers issue tracking, project boards,
            continuous integration through GitHub Actions, and integrated documentation via wikis and README files. It
            also serves as a vast open-source community hub, where millions of developers share code, learn from each
            other, and collaborate on projects across the globe.
            <br><br>
            In short, Git is the engine that powers version control, while GitHub is the platform that connects people
            around that engine. Git can exist without GitHub, and many developers use Git with other hosting services or
            entirely offline. GitHub, however, depends on Git as its foundation, enhancing it with a collaborative layer
            that turns isolated repositories into living, evolving projects.
