        <h1 class="hh">Express.js – The Minimalist Web Framework for Node.js</h1>

        <p class="pp">Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework built on top of Node.js. It
            streamlines the process of creating web servers and APIs by providing a clear and structured way to handle
            HTTP requests, responses, routing, and middleware. While Node.js alone can serve web content, Express
            abstracts away much of the repetitive boilerplate, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather
            than low-level server details.
            <br><br>
            At its core, Express.js operates around a middleware-based architecture. Middleware functions are executed
            in sequence for each request, performing tasks such as parsing request bodies, handling cookies, serving
            static files, logging, authentication, or custom processing. This layered approach allows developers to
            easily extend functionality by adding or reordering middleware, making the framework both highly adaptable
            and maintainable.
            <br><br>
            One of Express’s key strengths is its routing system. Routes define how an application responds to different
            HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns. This enables precise control over the behavior
            of the application based on the type of request and its intended resource. The routing API is simple yet
            powerful, allowing for modular route definitions that keep large applications organized.
            <br><br>
            Express.js is unopinionated, meaning it does not enforce a strict project structure or specific design
            patterns. This gives developers freedom to organize their code as they see fit, whether they are building a
            simple single-file server or a complex, multi-layered application. It also integrates seamlessly with
            templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars for rendering dynamic HTML on the server side, though it
            can just as easily serve JSON for APIs.
            <br><br>
            Because Express is built on Node.js’s non-blocking, event-driven foundation, it inherits the ability to
            handle large numbers of concurrent requests efficiently. This makes it suitable for building everything from
            small utilities to high-traffic web services. Its ecosystem of community-created middleware and extensions
            further accelerates development by providing ready-made solutions for common tasks.
            <br><br>
            Express.js is often used as the backbone of RESTful APIs, enabling client-side applications — whether built
            with React, Angular, Vue, or native mobile technologies — to communicate with servers via structured
            endpoints. It’s also a popular choice for microservices, where its simplicity and modularity help teams
            build, deploy, and maintain small, focused services that work together as part of a larger system.
            <br><br>
            In essence, Express.js is about reducing friction in back-end development. It offers the essentials for
            handling requests and responses, then gets out of the way, letting developers customize behavior to suit
            their needs. This balance between simplicity and power has made it the most widely used web framework for
            Node.js, trusted by startups, enterprises, and open-source projects alike.
