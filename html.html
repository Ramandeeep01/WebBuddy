        <h1 class="hh">HTML - The Foundation of the Web</h1>

        <p class="pp">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the structural framework of every web page on the internet.
            It defines the meaning, order, and relationships of the content a browser displays. While it doesn’t control
            styling or dynamic behavior, it provides the semantic scaffolding upon which other web technologies, such as
            CSS and JavaScript, operate.
            <br><br>
            At its core, HTML is concerned with content organization and meaning. It ensures that information is
            arranged in a logical hierarchy so that both humans and machines can interpret it effectively. Search
            engines use HTML’s structure to understand the topic of a page, accessibility tools rely on it to narrate
            content for visually impaired users, and browsers use it to determine what elements should appear and in
            what order.
            <br><br>
            The language is markup-based, meaning it relies on annotations embedded alongside content. These annotations
            describe the role each piece of content plays—whether it’s a heading, paragraph, navigation link, or
            embedded media. This approach ensures that the same content can be interpreted consistently across platforms
            and devices.
            <br><br>
            One of HTML’s key strengths lies in its semantic capability. Over time, it has evolved to include elements
            that convey specific meanings, such as defining sections of a document, specifying interactive controls, or
            denoting metadata about the page. This semantic clarity is critical for improving accessibility, enabling
            devices such as screen readers to accurately describe content to users, and for improving the effectiveness
            of search engine optimization.
            <br><br>
            HTML is also designed to be extensible and adaptable. While the base specification outlines the core
            elements and their intended purposes, it works hand-in-hand with other technologies through APIs,
            attributes, and embedded resources. This interoperability makes it possible to integrate multimedia, link to
            external resources, and interact with scripts that enhance functionality.
            <br><br>
            From a broader perspective, HTML acts as the universal publishing format of the web. Regardless of the
            browser, device, or operating system, it provides a common language that ensures content is readable and
            navigable. Its design philosophy emphasizes backward compatibility, meaning even older HTML documents can
            still be rendered on modern browsers.
            <br><br>
            While HTML itself does not handle presentation or logic, its role is foundational. CSS depends on it to
            target specific elements for styling, and JavaScript relies on it to identify and manipulate parts of the
            page dynamically. Without HTML, the visual richness of CSS and the interactivity of JavaScript would have no
            structure to operate upon.
            <br><br>
            In essence, HTML is not just about placing words and images on a page—it is about structuring information in
            a meaningful, accessible, and machine-readable way. This makes it the enduring bedrock of web development,
            as relevant today as it was in the earliest days of the internet.
