        <h1 class="hh">CSS – The Language of Presentation</h1>

        <p class="pp">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the technology that defines how HTML content is presented to
            users. While HTML provides the structural and semantic foundation of a webpage, CSS determines the visual
            characteristics — colors, spacing, typography, and overall layout. Together, they form the essential pairing
            that shapes how the web both looks and feels.
            <br><br>
            The defining principle of CSS is separation of concerns. By keeping structure and presentation distinct, web
            content becomes easier to maintain, adapt, and reuse. Designers can modify the appearance of an entire site
            by adjusting a single stylesheet, without altering the underlying HTML. This modularity allows for rapid
            changes and consistent visual identity across large-scale projects.
            <br><br>
            The “cascading” in CSS refers to its method of resolving conflicts when multiple style rules apply to the
            same element. CSS uses a combination of specificity, source order, and inheritance to determine which styles
            take precedence. This cascade system allows flexibility but also demands careful planning to maintain
            predictable results, especially in complex projects with many overlapping styles.
            <br><br>
            CSS is not limited to colors and fonts; it also governs layout. Over the years, it has evolved from basic
            box-model positioning to advanced layout systems. Modern tools such as Flexbox and Grid provide developers
            with precise control over element arrangement, enabling designs that adapt fluidly to different screen sizes
            and orientations. This adaptability is central to responsive design, where the same content adjusts
            seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
            <br><br>
            Beyond static styling, CSS offers dynamic features. Transitions and animations allow smooth visual changes,
            while transforms enable rotation, scaling, and other spatial effects without requiring scripting. These
            features contribute to user experience by guiding attention, signaling interactivity, and making interfaces
            feel more responsive.
            <br><br>
            CSS also supports theming and customization through variables, known as custom properties. This capability
            lets developers define reusable style values — for example, a color palette — that can be updated in one
            place and applied consistently throughout a project. Combined with media queries, this makes it possible to
            create designs that respond not only to screen size but also to user preferences, such as dark mode.
            <br><br>
            In essence, CSS is the visual language of the web. It transforms raw HTML into an engaging, user-friendly
            experience, balancing aesthetic appeal with functional clarity. While it operates in the background, its
            influence is felt immediately: a well-crafted stylesheet can make information not just visible, but truly
            accessible and enjoyable to consume.
