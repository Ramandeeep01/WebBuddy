        <h1 class="hh">Node.js – JavaScript Beyond the Browser</h1>

        <p class="pp">Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed outside the web browser,
            most commonly on servers. Built on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine — the same core that powers Chrome —
            Node.js takes JavaScript, traditionally limited to client-side scripting, and extends its reach to back-end
            development. This transformation enables developers to use a single programming language across the entire
            stack, from browser interfaces to server logic.
            <br><br>
            The defining characteristic of Node.js is its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Unlike traditional
            server environments that handle each request with a separate thread, Node.js operates on a single thread,
            using an event loop to process multiple requests concurrently. When a request involves a time-consuming
            operation, such as reading from a database or fetching data from an API, Node.js delegates the task to the
            system and continues handling other requests. Once the operation is complete, a callback or promise resumes
            execution. This model allows Node.js to handle high concurrency with minimal resource usage, making it
            particularly well-suited for real-time applications.
            <br><br>
            Node.js uses JavaScript modules to organize code, with the npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem providing
            access to an enormous library of reusable packages. Developers can quickly integrate functionality such as
            authentication, database connections, and file handling without reinventing common patterns. This ecosystem
            has become one of the largest collections of open-source software in the world.
            <br><br>
            A major advantage of Node.js is its suitability for real-time, data-intensive applications. Use cases
            include chat servers, multiplayer games, live dashboards, streaming services, and collaborative editing
            tools — any scenario where rapid, bidirectional communication between client and server is essential. By
            using WebSockets or similar protocols, Node.js can maintain persistent connections, enabling updates to be
            pushed instantly rather than polled periodically.
            <br><br>
            Node.js does not provide a built-in web server by default, but it makes it simple to create one. Libraries
            like Express.js have become popular companions, offering tools to route requests, handle middleware, and
            manage application logic. This combination allows developers to quickly build scalable, maintainable APIs
            and web applications.
            <br><br>
            While Node.js excels at I/O-bound tasks, it is less suited for CPU-intensive operations, such as large-scale
            data processing, because such tasks can block the event loop. However, with worker threads and clustering,
            developers can distribute heavy workloads across multiple processes or cores.
            <br><br>
            In essence, Node.js redefines what JavaScript can do. By breaking free from the browser and embracing
            asynchronous, event-driven design, it allows developers to build fast, scalable, and unified applications
            that use the same language for both client and server. This unification streamlines development, fosters
            code reuse, and powers many of today’s most demanding web applications.
